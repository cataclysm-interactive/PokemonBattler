05-10 - Finished downloading all 826 pokemon moves, and put them all into a text file that sits where the program executes so that it can load them all in. I'll do something similar for the Pokemon

05-11 - Turns out I didn't download the moves properly, time to do it again!

05-12 - Actually programmed the part of the game that imports all *426 moves. I scrapped a bunch of them cause they're too weird for me to care about how they work.

05-16 - Added Damage Super effectiveness, and the ACTUAL POKEMON DAMAGE CALCUATION. 
 
05-17 - Finished Super effectiveness/effectiveness, Thats a lot of switch cases. Also started work on the 2nd python script to download and format all the data from the pokeAPI
//Note: This project has been really smooth sailing for me, and except for me googling small things, like how to turn an Int into a String, there really haven't been many issues.
05-18 - Added part 1 of the team builder, Players can now select the MOVES for their pokemon, which is currently just a lvl 100 eevee.

05-19 - Started work on part 2 of the team builder. Selecting Pokemon.
